### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about Css Flexbox and CSS Variables throughout this Project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.social-media-item:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  background: var(--green); /* Variable */
  color: var(--off-black);
}
```

### Continued development

In future, I focus on CSS Responsiveness using Media Query. and want to focus on more CSS FlexBox and Grid Layout.

### Useful resources

- [CSS FlexBox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for display Property and Setting Each and Every Layout.
- [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This helped me for decrease Duplicating values using CSS Variables. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
